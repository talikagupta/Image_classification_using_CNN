Image Classification using CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The dataset used is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
Here are the classes in the dataset, as well as 10 random images from each class:
